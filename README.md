# Electron1C

An experimental node.js / Electron wrapper around Apple Music Web.

This is going to be my first ever Node project, so bare with me and my spaghetti code.

## But Cider exists!

Yes, however I tend to prefer the Apple Music Web UI a bit more. I will give Cider that, it has some really cool features, but the accessibility isn't the best so I'll just stick to the good old Web UI thank you very much.

## How to run?

There's no releases for now as I just got started working on this project. Binary builds will probably come in the near future though.

First install Node, then run the below command:

$ npm install&&npm start

## Contributions welcome!

As mentioned earlier this is my first ever Node project. If you find any inconsistancies that my little brain didn't notice, feel free to submit an issue or pull-request. I'll be eternally grateful.
