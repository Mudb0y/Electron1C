# Electron1C

An experimental node.js / Electron wrapper around Apple Music Web.

This is going to be my first ever Node project, so bare with me and my spaghetti code.

## But Cider exists!

Yes, however I tend to prefer the Apple Music Web UI a bit more. I will give Cider that, it has some really cool features, but the accessibility isn't the best so I'll just stick to the good old Web UI thank you very much.

## Nothing to see here, for now.

I usually make in progress repositories private, especially when they might never come to fruition, but I thought I might just as well make this public. It won't hurt anybody. I might however subject my self to people being angry for stale and empty public repositories though. I'm sorry, I promise I'll be a good boy and if I can't get off of my ass to code I'll probably delete it.

Let's just hope it doesn't come to that and this here project goes somewhere.
